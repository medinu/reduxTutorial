# Learning Redux :grinning: 

## Description
Redux is a state management tool that can be used to create and manage a global state. The global state then can be accessed through out the component heirarchy without having to flow the necessary data down. The Redux store also allows for the creation of predefined actions that can be called using functions called dispatchers which calls the reducer function to modify the global state. 

Through the use of redux we can reduce the need to propogate variables through multiple layers of component. This greatly reduces naming error thus reducing development time. Also, since state manipulating actions are predefined the chances of illegaly mutating the state is greatly reduced and performance as well as bugs are reduced.
